                    <p>The solar system is the planetary system that gravitationally binds a set of astronomical objects
                        that rotate directly or indirectly in an orbit around a single star known as the Sun.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The solar system was formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of a molecular cloud.
                         The residual material originated a protoplanetary circumstellar disk in which the physical processes that led to the formation of the planets occurred.

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Neptune is the eighth planet in distance from the Sun and the farthest in the solar system. It is part of the so-called outer planets, and within these, it is one of the frozen giants, and it is the first to be discovered thanks to mathematical predictions. <br>
                        Its name was placed in honor of the Roman god of the sea - Neptune - and it is the fourth planet in diameter and the third largest in mass. Its mass is seventeen times that of Earth and slightly greater than that of its "twin" planet Uranus, which has 15 Earth masses and is not as dense.
